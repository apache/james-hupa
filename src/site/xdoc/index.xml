        <section name="What is Hupa?">
            <p> Hupa is an Rich IMAP-based Webmail application written in GWT
                (Google Web Toolkit).          </p>
            <p> Hupa has been entirely written in java to be coherent with the
                language used in the James project. And It has been a reference of a
                devloping using GWT good practices (MVP pattern and Unit testing) </p>
            <p> Hupa is a functional and well designed email client, ready for
                reading, sending and managing messages, but it still lacks of many features
                email clients nowadays have.</p>

        <section name="Demo">
            <p> There are two instances of Hupa running in the ASF infra. One is
                configured to use GMail IMAP and SMTP servers, so any gmail account
                should work. The other one uses a set of messages used to test Hupa
                with fake imap and smtp servers implementations.
