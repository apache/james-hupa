        <section name="What is Hupa?">
          <p> Hupa is an Rich IMAP-based Webmail application written in GWT (Google Web Toolkit).          </p>
          <p> Hupa has been entirely written in java to be coherent with the language used in the James project. And It has been a reference of a devloping using GWT good practices (MVP pattern and Unit testing) </p>
          <p> Hupa is a functional and well designed email client, ready for reading, sending and managing messages, but it lacks of many features email clients nowadays have like address book </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Demo">
          <p> There is an instance of Hupa running in ASF infra. It is configured to use GMail IMAP and SMTP servers, so any gmail account should work. </p>
          <p> Note that your gmail account must have imap enabled. Because the instance and gmail servers are far away and caching is not functional yet, you will notice a latency when moving through the application </p>
